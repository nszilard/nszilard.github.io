  Hi, my name's Szilard and I'm a DevSecOps engineer.

  As a Computer science engineer, I have acquired broad knowledge in computer networks as well as in computer programming languages. I have had the opportunity to work with the Networking research team at Budapest University of Technology where I learned how to work both alone and in a team to overcome challenges no-one has faced before.  
  During my master studies I was able to expand my expertise in service delivery in traditional, as well as in cloud networks.  
  By starting my career in a startup company in London, I was able to take full ownership and responsibility for all my projects, which allowed me to gain experience in an exponential manner.
