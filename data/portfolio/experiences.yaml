    - Designed the `AWS` network layout and created a Terraform module that unified the way to deploy new `VPCs`.
    - Successfully migrated a self-hosted `Verdaccio` registry to `GitHub Packages` and Git repositories from `BitBucket` to `GitHub`.
    - Automated Terraform projects using `Atlantis` and introduced `CircleCI` to the toolchain, leading to increased efficiency and a better user experience and collaboration.
    - Developed a `CLI` tool (at first in `NodeJS`, then later in `Golang`) to unify service packaging and deployment methods across all services, regardless of their backend,
    leading to standardized and streamlined deployment processes.
    - Replaced the need for `SSH keys` by relying on Hashicorp's Vault to generate `OTPs` based on the user's identity which allowed granular access control to instances and increased security.
    - Designed and implemented a highly available, scalable, and stateless infrastructure for `Unleash` and `Vault`.
    - Conducted in-depth research on Kubernetes (`EKS`) vs. `ECS Fargate` to lay the groundwork for microservices, and provided an IaC template that can be reused for any project.
    - Developed custom `AWS Lambda` functions to automate the backup processes for `DynamoDB` tables and the cleanup of `ECR repositories`, resulting in improved disaster recovery capabilities and cost savings.
    - Implemented a private NPM registry (`Verdaccio`) and automated license scanning and vulnerability checks in dependencies for increased security and compliance.
    - Refactored `Terraform` workflows to use modules, leading to better maintainability and scalability.
    - Automated continuous delivery for `Lambdas` and `Auto Scaling Groups`.
    - Created a custom `Slack` integration for Jenkins that included detailed information from each build, improving communication and transparency.
    - Implemented a `CI/CD` system (`Jenkins`) from the ground up which resulted in increased stability, predictability and frequency of deployments.
    - Imported all existing infrastructure to `Terraform`, ensuring that every IaC is up to date and optimized for maintainability.
