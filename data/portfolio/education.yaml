      During my Master's studies, I `graduated with distinction` in every module and achieved overall distinction. The program consisted of the following courses:

        * ICT Configuration and Administration
        * Client Server Network Architecture
        * Data Communications and Networking
        * Unified Communications
        * Network Design and Management
        * Communications Security

      These courses provided me with a strong foundation in the field of networking, including the design and management of networks, security protocols, and communication technologies.

      __Specialization:__ `Info-communication networks and applications`

      I had the opportunity to explore a wide range of programming languages and technologies each semester. I found myself particularly drawn to the `Computing theory` and `Computer network` modules and excelled in these areas. My passion for computer networks led to me being invited to the `MEDIANETS Computer-Networks Talent Group`. <br>
      In addition, I was honoured to receive the `"IEEE Communication Society Special Award"` for my dissertation, which was the culmination of my academic achievements during my Bachelor's degree.
