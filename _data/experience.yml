    - Migrated over the NodeJS CLI tool to Golang, and expanded its functionality to include general/common functions
    - Replaced the need for SSH keys by relying on Hashicorp’s Vault to generate OTPs based on the user’s identity which allowed granular access control to instances
    - Adopted _[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)_ into our toolchain by providing a highly available, scalable and stateless infrastructure
    - Designed the AWS network layout and created a Terraform module that unified the way to deploy new VPCs
    - Revisited the _[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io)_ infrastructure and made it highly available scalable and stateless. Set up the user authentication to use _[Google OIDC](https://developers.google.com/identity)_ method
    - Implemented a private NPM registry _([Verdaccio](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio))_ in a highly-available, scalable and stateless infrastructure
    - Automated licence scanning of dependencies
    - Automated vulnerability checks in dependencies
    - Refactored _[Terraform](https://terraform.io)_ workflows to use modules instead
